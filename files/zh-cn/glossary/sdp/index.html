<p><strong>SDP </strong>(Session Description <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol" class="glossaryLink" title="Protocol: A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers. Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol.">Protocol</a>) 是一个描述<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/P2P" class="glossaryLink" title="peer-to-peer: P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a computer networking architecture in which all participating nodes (peers) have equal privileges and share the workload. P2P differs from a client-server network architecture, where multiple client nodes connect to centralized servers for services. P2P is commonly found in Blockchain Applications.">peer-to-peer</a> 连接的标准. SDP包含音视频的:编解码(<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/codec" class="glossaryLink" title="codec: A codec  (a blend word derived from &quot;coder-decoder&quot;) is a program, algorithm, or device that encodes or decodes a data stream. A given codec knows how to handle a specific encoding or compression technology.">codec</a>),源地址,和时间信息.</p>

<p>下面是一个典型的SDP信息示例:</p>

 SDP协议从不会被单独使用,而是依靠 <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP" class="glossaryLink" title="RTP: Real-time transport protocol (RTP) is a network protocol which described how to transmit various media (audio, video) from one endpoint to another in a real-time fashion. RTP is suitable for video-streaming application, telephony over IP like Skype and conference technologies.">RTP</a> 和<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTSP" class="glossaryLink" title="RTSP: Real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) is a network protocol that controls how the streaming of a media should occur between a server and a client. Basically, RTSP is the protocol that describes what happens when you click &quot;Pause&quot;/&quot;Play&quot; when streaming a video. If your computer were a remote control and the streaming server a television, RTSP would describe how the instruction of the remote control affects the TV.">RTSP</a>等协议.SDP也作为<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebRTC" class="glossaryLink" title="WebRTC: WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API that can be used by video-chat, voice-calling, and P2P-file-sharing Web apps.">WebRTC</a>的组件之一,用于描述一个session会话.</p>
