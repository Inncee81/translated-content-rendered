 <dd>Storing passwords in plain text can lead to attackers knowing and leaking the exact password of your site&apos;s users, potentially putting the users at risk. The same issues can arise if you use an old or insecure algorithm for hashing (such as md5). You should use a password-specific hashing algorithm (such as Argon2, PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt) instead of message digest algorithms (such as md5 and sha). This article showcases best practices to use when storing passwords.</dd>
