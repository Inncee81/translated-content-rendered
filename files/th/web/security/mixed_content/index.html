<p>When a user visits a page served over <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, their connection with the web server is encrypted with <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS">TLS</a> and is therefore safeguarded from most sniffers and man-in-the-middle attacks. <span class="seoSummary">An HTTPS page that includes content fetched using cleartext HTTP is called a <strong>mixed content</strong> page. Pages like this are only partially encrypted, leaving the unencrypted content accessible to sniffers and man-in-the-middle attackers.</span> That leaves the pages unsafe.</p>

<h2 id="Types_of_mixed_content">Types of mixed content</h2>

<p>There are two categories for mixed content: <strong>mixed passive/display content</strong> and <strong>mixed active content</strong>. The difference lies in the threat level of the worst case scenario if content is rewritten as part of a man-in-the-middle attack. In the case of passive content, the threat is lower (the page may contain misleading content, or the user's cookies may be stolen). In the case of active content, the threat can lead to phishing, sensitive data disclosure, redirection to malicious sites, etc.</p>

<h3 id="Mixed_passivedisplay_content">Mixed passive/display content</h3>

<p>Mixed passive/display content is content served over HTTP that is included in an HTTPS webpage, but that cannot alter other portions of the webpage. For example, an attacker could replace an image served over HTTP with an inappropriate image or message to the user. The attacker could also infer information about the user's activities by watching which images are served to the user; often images are only served on a specific page within a website. If the attacker observes HTTP requests to certain images, they could determine which webpage the user is visiting.</p>

<h4 id="Passive_content_list">Passive content list</h4>

<p>This section lists all types of HTTP requests which are considered passive content:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img" title="The HTML &lt;img> element embeds an image into the document."><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio" title="The HTML &lt;audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the &lt;source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream."><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video" title="The HTML Video element (&lt;video>) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use &lt;video> for audio content as well, but the &lt;audio> element may provide a more appropriate user experience."><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object" title="The HTML &lt;object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin."><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></a> subresources (when an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> performs HTTP requests)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Mixed_active_content">Mixed active content</h3>

<p><strong>Mixed active content</strong> is content that has access to all or parts of the Document Object Model of the HTTPS page. This type of mixed content can alter the behavior of the HTTPS page and potentially steal sensitive data from the user. Hence, in addition to the risks described for mixed display content above, mixed active content is vulnerable to a few other attack vectors.</p>

<p>In the mixed active content case, a man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept the request for the HTTP content. The attacker can also rewrite the response to include malicious JavaScript code. Malicious active content can steal the user's credentials, acquire sensitive data about the user, or attempt to install malware on the user's system (by leveraging vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins, for example).</p>

<p>The risk involved with mixed content does depend on the type of website the user is visiting and how sensitive the data exposed to that site may be. The webpage may have public data visible to the world or private data visible only when authenticated. If the webpage is public and has no sensitive data about the user, using mixed active content still provides the attacker with the opportunity to redirect the user to other HTTP pages and steal HTTP cookies from those sites.</p>

<h4 id="Active_content_examples">Active content examples</h4>

<p>This section lists some types of HTTP requests which are considered active content:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script" title="The HTML &lt;script> element is used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code."><code>&lt;script&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" title='The HTML External Resource Link element (&lt;link>) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.'><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a> (<code>href</code> attribute) (this includes CSS stylesheets)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe" title="The HTML Inline Frame element (&lt;iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one."><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a> (<code>src</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> requests</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> requests</li>
 <li>All cases in CSS where a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url" title="The &lt;url> CSS data type denotes a pointer to a resource, such as an image or a font. URLs can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, cursor, and list-style."><code>&lt;url&gt;</code></a> value is used (<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face" title="The @font-face CSS at-rule specifies a custom font with which to display text; the font can be loaded from either a remote server or a locally-installed font on the user's own computer."><code>@font-face</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor" title="The cursor CSS property sets the type of cursor, if any, to show when the mouse pointer is over an element."><code>cursor</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image" title="The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element."><code>background-image</code></a>, and so forth).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object" title="The HTML &lt;object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin."><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></a> (<code>data</code> attribute)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon"><code>Navigator.sendBeacon</code></a> (<code>url</code> attribute)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other resource types like web fonts and workers may be considered active mixed content, as they are in Chrome.</p>

<h2 id="Warnings_in_Web_Console">Warnings in Web Console</h2>

<p>The Firefox Web Console displays a mixed content warning message in the Net pane when a page on your website has this issue. The mixed content resource that was loaded via HTTP will show up in red, along with the text "mixed content", which links to this page.</p>

<p><a class="internal" href="/files/12545/Mixed_content_-_Net_pane.png"><img alt="Screen shot of the web console displaying a mixed content warning." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12545/Mixed_content_-_Net_pane.png" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; height: 286px; width: 720px;"></a></p>

<p>As well as finding these warnings in the Web Console, you could use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> to report issues. You could also use an online crawler like <a href="http://www.jitbit.com/sslcheck/" rel="noopener">SSL-check</a> or <a href="https://www.missingpadlock.com/" rel="noopener">Missing Padlock</a> that will check your website recursively and find links to insecure content.</p>

<p>Starting in Firefox 23, mixed active content is blocked by default (and mixed display content can be blocked by setting a preference). To make it easier for web developers to find mixed content errors, all blocked mixed content requests are logged to the Security pane of the Web Console, as seen below:</p>

<p><a href="/files/5261/blocked-mixed-content-errors.png"><img alt="A screenshot of blocked mixed content errors in the Security Pane of the Web Console" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12543/mixed_content_webconsole.png" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; height: 285px; width: 720px;"></a></p>

<p>To fix this type of error, all requests to HTTP content should be removed and replaced with content served over HTTPS. Some common examples of mixed content include JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, videos, and other media.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since Firefox 55, the loading of mixed content is allowed on http://127.0.0.1/ (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903966">bug 903966</a>). Chrome allows mixed content on http://127.0.0.1/ and http://localhost/. Safari does not allow any mixed content.</p>
