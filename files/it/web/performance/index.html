<p><span class="seoSummary">Web performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime. Web performance is how long a site takes to load, become interactive and responsive, and how smooth the content is during user interactions </span>- is the scrolling smooth? are buttons clickable? Are pop-ups quick to open up, and do they animate smoothly as they do so? Web performance includes both objective measurements like time to load, frames per second, and time to interactive, and subjective experiences of how long it felt like it took the content to load.</p>

<p>The longer it takes for a site to respond, the more users will abandon the site. It is important to minimize the loading and response times, and add additional features to conceal latency by making the experience as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible, while asynchronously loading in the longer tail parts of the experience.</p>

<p>There are tools, APIs, and best practices that help us measure and improve web performance. We cover them in this section</p>

 <dd>This article starts the module off with a good look at what Performance actually is — this includes the tools, metrics, APIs, networks, and groups of people we need to consider when thinking about performance, and how we can make Performance part of our web development workflow.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/web_performance_basics">Web Performance Basics</a></dt>
 <dd>In addition to the front end components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, there are features that can make applications slower and features that can make applications subjectively and objectively faster. There are many APIs, Developer Tools, best practices and bad practices relating to web performance. Here we'll introduce many of these features ad the basic level and provide links to deeper dives to improve performance for each topic.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/perceived_performance">How do users perceive performance?</a></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>More important than how fast your website is in milliseconds, is how fast do your users perceive your site to be. Page load time, idling, responsiveness to user interaction, and the smoothness of scrolling and other animations impact these perceptions. In this article, we discuss the various loading metrics, animation, and responsiveness metrics, along with best practices to improve user perception, if not the actual timings.</p>

 <dd>Frequently, media optimization is the lowest hanging fruit of web performance. Serving different media files based on each user agent's capability, size, and pixel density is possible. Additional tips, like removing audio tracks from background images, can improve performance even further. In this article, we discuss the impact video, audio, and image content has on performance, and the methods to ensure that impact is as minimal as possible.</dd>

 <dd>
 <p>The transport layer—that is, HTTP—is utterly essential to the functioning of the web, and it has only been relatively recently that it has seen a major update in the form of HTTP/2. Out of the box, HTTP/2 provides many performance improvements and advantages over its predecessor, but it also changes the landscape. In this article, you'll learn what HTTP/2 does for you, and how to fine-tune your application to make it do go even further.</p>

 <dt>The role of TLS in performance</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>TLS—or HTTPS as we tend to call it—is crucial in creating secure and safe user experiences. While hardware has reduced the negative impacts TLS has had on server performance, it still represents a substantial slice of the time we spend waiting for browsers to connect to servers. This article explains the TLS handshake process, and offers some tips for reducing this time, such as OCSP stapling, HSTS preload headers, and the potential role of resource hints in masking TLS latency for third parties.</p>

 <dt>Reading performance charts</dt>
 <dd>Developer tools provide information on performance, memory, and network requests.

 <dt>Analyzing JavaScript bundles</dt>
 <dd>No doubt, JavaScript is a big part of modern web development. While you should always strive to reduce the amount of JavaScript you use in your applications, it can be difficult to know where to start. <span class="veryhardreadability"><span><span>In this guide, we'll show you how to analyze your application's script bundles, so you know </span></span><em><span>what</span></em><span><span> you're using, as well how to detect if your app contains duplicated scripts between bundles</span></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading">Lazy loading</a></dt>
 <dd>It isn't always necessary to load all of a web applications assets on initial page load. Lazy Loading is defering the loading of assets on a page, such as scripts, images, etc., on a page to a later point in time – when those assets are actually needed.</dd>
 <dt>Lazy-loading JavaScript with import()</dt>
 <dd>The term "lazy loading" often refers to load deferment techniques for assets not needed at load such as loading below-the-fold imagery only when those images scroll into the view. Now there are native features to load JavaScript! In this guide, we'll talk about the dynamic import() statement, a newer browser feature, that loads a JavaScript module on demand.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Controlling_resource_delivery_with_resource_hints">Controlling resource delivery with resource hints</a></dt>
 <dd>Browsers often know better than we do when it comes to resource prioritization and delivery—but they're far from clairyovant. Native browser features enable us to hint to the browser when it should connect to another server, or preload a resource before the browser knows it ever needs it. When used judiciously, this can make fast experience seem even faster. In this article, we cover native browser features like rel=preconnect, rel=dns-prefetch, rel=prefetch, and rel=preload, and how to use them to your advantage.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Performance_budget">Performance Budgets</a></dt>
 <dd>Marketing, design, and sales needs, and developer experience, often ad bloat, third-party scripts, and other features that can slow down web performance. To help set priorities, it is helpful to set a performance budget: a set of restrictions to not exceed during the development phase. In this article, we'll discuss creating and sticking to a performance budget. </dd>
