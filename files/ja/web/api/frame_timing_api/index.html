<p>The <strong><code>PerformanceFrameTiming</code></strong> interface provides <em>frame</em> timing data about the browser&apos;s event loop. A <em>frame</em> represents the amount of work a browser does in <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8">one event loop iteration</a> such as processing DOM events, resizing, scrolling, rendering, CSS animations, etc. A <em>frame rate</em> of 60 fps (frames per second) for a 60 Hz refresh rate is a common target for a good <em>responsive</em> user experience. This means the browser should process a frame in about 16.7 ms.</p>

<p>An application can register a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" title="The PerformanceObserver interface is used to observe performance measurement events and be notified of new performance entries as they are recorded in the browser&apos;s performance timeline."><code>PerformanceObserver</code></a> for &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry" title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline. A performance entry can be directly created by making a performance mark or measure (for example by calling the mark() method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways such as loading a resource (such as an image)."><code>performance entry types</code></a>. The <em>observer</em> (callback) will be notified when new &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; events are added to the browser&apos;s <em>performance timeline</em> and the frame&apos;s <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry/duration" title="The duration property returns a timestamp that is the duration of the performance entry."><code>duration</code></a> (length of time) will be available. This data can be used to help identify areas that take too long to provide a good user experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceFrameTiming" title="PerformanceFrameTiming is an abstract interface that provides frame timing data about the browser&apos;s event loop."><code>PerformanceFrameTiming</code></a> interface extends the following <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry" title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline. A performance entry can be directly created by making a performance mark or measure (for example by calling the mark() method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways such as loading a resource (such as an image)."><code>PerformanceEntry</code></a> properties (for &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry/entryType" title="The entryType property returns a DOMString representing the type of performance metric such as, for example, &quot;mark&quot;. This property is read only."><code>performance entry types</code></a>) by qualifying and constrainting the properties as follows:</p>

</dl>

<p>This data, particularly the <code>duration</code> timestamp, can be used to help identify performance problems.</p>

<h2 id="Frame_observers">Frame observers</h2>

<p><span title="This is an experimental API that should not be used in production code."><i class="icon-beaker"> </i></span>The <em>performance observer</em> interfaces allow an application to register an <em>observer</em> for specific <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry" title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline. A performance entry can be directly created by making a performance mark or measure (for example by calling the mark() method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways such as loading a resource (such as an image)."><code>performance event types</code></a>. When one of those event types is recorded in the browser&apos;s <em>performance timeline</em>, the application is notified of the event via the observer&apos;s callback function that was specified when the observer was created.</p>

<p>To observe &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; performance entry types, the application first creates a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" title="The PerformanceObserver interface is used to observe performance measurement events and be notified of new performance entries as they are recorded in the browser&apos;s performance timeline."><code>PerformanceObserver</code></a> object with a specific frame observer callback (function). Next, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver/observe" title="The observe() method of the PerformanceObserver interface is used to specify the set of performance entry types to observe. "><code>PerformanceObserver.observe()</code></a> is used to specify the set of performance events to observe - in this case, just the &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; event type. When the browser adds a new frame to the performance timeline, the specified observer callback will be invoked.</p>

<h2 id="Accessing_frame_data">Accessing frame data</h2>

<p>When a frame <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" title="The PerformanceObserver interface is used to observe performance measurement events and be notified of new performance entries as they are recorded in the browser&apos;s performance timeline."><code>observer</code></a> is invoked, frame <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry" title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline. A performance entry can be directly created by making a performance mark or measure (for example by calling the mark() method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways such as loading a resource (such as an image)."><code>performance entries</code></a> can be retrieved by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserverEntryList/getEntriesByType" title="The getEntriesByType() method of the PerformanceObserverEntryList returns a list of explicitly observed performance entry objects for a given performance entry type. The list&apos;s members are determined by the set of entry types specified in the call to the observe() method.

This method returns a list of &quot;<code>frame</code>&quot; <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry" title="The PerformanceEntry object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline.

Each frame object&apos;s <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry/duration" title="The duration property returns a timestamp that is the duration of the performance entry."><code>duration</code></a> property returns the timestamp of two consecutive frames. If this value is greater than the time needed to provide a good user experience, further analysis might be warranted.</p>
