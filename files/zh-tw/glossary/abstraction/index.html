These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands. These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.">computer programming</a> 領域中，抽象化可用來減少軟體系統複雜度，讓設計及使用效率提升。用簡單的 <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/API" class="glossaryLink" title="APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface.
